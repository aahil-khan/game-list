## Game List

This is a Nextjs project to view and review various console games

Highlights-

1) A 3D responsive animated background
2) A fully functioning Postgresql Database connected to the app from which all data is fetched on initial loading
3) Implementation of a Public API ie gamebomb.com. All the data except from the user input is fetched from this API
4) A Fresh and vibrant frontend
5) Intuitive use of React Hooks

Notes-

1) This project hasn't been deployed yet so the only way to view it right now is through the demo video above
2) Please ignore the ```white screen``` mid loading as this is not a production build which would take care of the optimisations
